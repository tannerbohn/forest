- What is Forest?
	- Forest is a note-taking/brainstorming interface made with Textual which is built around the idea of organizing notes into nested branches, and being able to zoom into branches
- Moving around
	- up and down
	- left (move up in the tree), right (move deeper into the tree -- useful if you want to focus on something)
	- to exit the forest, type Ctrl-Q. Make sure you have saved any changes first!

- Using the journal
	- to add a journal entry (a journal branch will automatically be created), use :j+ <entry>
	- journal entries are automatically sorted into branches for the year and month
- What's up with the white/blue strip on the left?
	- This strip reflects the age of a note. New ones are bright blue, and as the get older, they will slowly fade
- Executable notes
	- if a note starts with "!", then you can execute the contents in a subprocess with :run
