- What is Forest?
	- Forest is a note-taking/brainstorming interface made with Textual, built around the idea of organizing notes into nested branches and being able to zoom into branches
	- To exit Forest, press Ctrl-Q
- Navigation
	- Up and down arrows to move between notes
	- Left arrow zooms out (moves up in the tree), right arrow zooms in (focuses on the current branch)
	- Space toggles collapse/expand on any note with children
		- Look! This branch is collapsed!
			- It can have so many things inside
	- 0-9 jumps to a bookmarked note
- Creating notes
	- Press Enter to add a new note below the cursor
	- While typing, you can press Tab or Shift+Tab at the start of the line to indent or de-indent it
- #Editing notes
	- Press e or Backspace to edit a note. Press Enter when done, or Esc to cancel
	- x toggles a note as complete (dims the note and its children) #DONE
	- X toggles hiding all #DONE notes from view
	- Tab and Shift+Tab indent and de-indent a note
	- Delete removes a note
	- u and d move a note up or down among its siblings
	- h cycles through highlight colours
		- primary highlight #HL1
		- secondary #HL2
		- tertiary #HL3
	- z to undo, Z to redo
- Saving
	- Press s to save. If you have unsaved changes, "Modified" will appear in the top bar
	- Auto-save is also enabled by default
- Command mode (press : to enter)
	- :?<query> searches within the current context (regex), :??<query> searches the whole tree (regex)
		- Use left/right arrows to cycle through matches, Enter to accept, Esc to cancel
		- While viewing LOCAL (:?) search results, press H to pin the highlight on the context node #HL1
			- The [[Command mode]] node has a pinned context highlight for the term "search" -- you can see it listed under "Active Highlights" if you press ` while at that note
		- Pressing x on a note with a contextual highlight removes it (first press), then toggles #DONE (second press)
		- if ">" appears in the search query, searching will compare against path strings, not just the note string
		- Empty query (:?) shows similar notes to current note in the side panel
			- when this similar-notes panel is visible, you can use the keys 0-9 to jump to one of the listed notes
	- :b or :bookmark toggles a bookmark on the current note
		- Press ` to open the side panel and see existing bookmarks
		- Jump to a bookmark by pressing its number key (0-9)
		- A maximum of 10 bookmarks are supported
	- :j+ <text> adds a timestamped journal entry (a journal branch is auto-created, organized by year and month)
	- :run [<index>] runs ! shell commands or follows [[PATH]] references
		- e.g. run the :run command on this note [[SAVING > AUTO-SAVE IS ALSO]]
		- If multiple [[PATH]] references exist, use :run 0, :run 1, etc.
	- :insert <name> inserts a predefined template subtree
	- :help shows the help panel
- Side panel
	- Press ` to cycle through the side panel views (bookmarks, similar notes) or hide it
- Input substitutions
	- Typing {NOW } in a note will be replaced with the current timestamp
- What's up with the coloured strip on the left?
	- This strip reflects the age of a note. New notes are bright, and as they get older they slowly fade
